The world of work has now undergone many developments, from making a cv using only notes, it has now developed into digital writing which sometimes looks more elegant. With this CV I would like to introduce myself. My name is Muhammad Kholil and I am a person who likes to learn new things, especially in the world of technology. I also like to photograph an object or image because it can represent my feelings which may not be expressed in words, but can be realized through a camera, why did I choose to enter the IT world because I see this advanced technological development making all work dependent on a person's ability to use technology and also what technology is used.
